# LockdownTraveller-Blitzkreig
Avishkar in Covid seemed an impossible task with an online semester, ongoing
placements and never ending lockdown. Anuj being the leader he is started managing it
all, be it scheduling classes or planning events he is all over the place. As Avishkar
approaches he is getting more and more desperate to bring in new sponsors for all
